How can we predict the price of a used car based on its attributes (e.g., brand, mileage, year, fuel type, etc.)
The case involves:
Attributes of Used Cars: Each row in the dataset likely represents a car listing. It might include features such as:
Brand/Model: Car make and model (e.g., Maruti Swift, Honda City).
Year: Year of manufacture.
Mileage: Distance the car has traveled (e.g., in km).
Fuel Type: Petrol, diesel, or electric.
Transmission: Manual or automatic.
Price: The target variable we want to predict.
Objective: To predict the selling price of a car based on these attributes.
